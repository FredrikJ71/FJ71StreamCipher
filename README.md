# FJ71StreamCipher
This project contains some implementations of algorithms and classes that can be used to study stream ciphers. The code is written in c++, however, the coding might be a little bit more C-like compared with modern C++.

Note! The implementations are suitable for study and research and should be used with caution in actual applications. The code has not thorougly been tested, hence, there might be errors and possibilities for side-channel attacks.
