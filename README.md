# CppTemplate
My template for C++ projects

The template conatins the initial folders for a new C++ project.
Together with the folders there is also a CMakeLists.txt for CMake and a .gitignore

## Folder structure
* bin: Output executables will be put here.
* build: Use this folder to build the files.
* doc: Extra documents if needed.
* include/project: Project header files. The name of the directory should be the same as the projects to simplify when moved to /usr/local/include
* lib: Libfiles created by the project and also third-party libraries.
* src: The application source files. This will also include cpp-files for internal libraries.
* test: Files for testing, including cpp-files for test applications
