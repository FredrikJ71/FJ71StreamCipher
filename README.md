# FJ71StreamCipher
This project contains some implementations of algorithms and classes that can be used to study stream ciphers. The code is written in c++, however, the coding might be a little bit more C-like compared with modern C++.

Note! The implementations are suitable for study and research and should not be used in actual applications. The reason is that the implementations are not tested for side-channel attacks.
